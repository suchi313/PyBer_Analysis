# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
During the course of this challenge, we assisted the CEO of PyBer - a ride sharing service. The goal was to help the CEO understand the following: 
* Number of rides taken 
* Total available rides 
* Price fares based on location (urban, suburban, rural). 
The scope of the work included: Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Utlizing these tools, I was able to create a summary DataFrame and a multi-line graph of the total fares for each city type.

## Learning Objective
The purpose of this challenge was to showcase and create the following:
1. Create an array of charts including: Line, Bar, Scatter, Bubble, Pie, and box-and-whisker plots. *I utlized Matplotlib for this.* 
2. Adding and Modifying features of the Matplotlib charts. 
3. Adding error bars to the line and bar charts. 
4. Identifying the mean, median, mode. *I utlized Pandas to determine this.*

## Results

### Summary DataFrame
